### Hello World, I'm mike!ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Developer from Brasil!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on new projects to increase my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React/Next.js and Node, also Unreal Engine on my free time
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything I guess. I'm good at google.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once was part of a Teeterboard troupe in the circus. Yep, not enough IT action there.
