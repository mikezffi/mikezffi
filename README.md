### Hello World, I'm mike!ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Developer from Brasil!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some bootcamp projects and my own "portfolio" website: mikezffi.com
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and Next.js, upgrading my front end skills before I got into the "deep stuff"
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on game development and gamification projects. (Not much dev experience but BOY I have a lot of hours in the "testing" department.)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything I guess. I'm good at google.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: e-mail: mikeaazuffi@gmail.com linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikezffi/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once was part of a Teeterboard troupe in the circus. Yep, not enough IT action there.
